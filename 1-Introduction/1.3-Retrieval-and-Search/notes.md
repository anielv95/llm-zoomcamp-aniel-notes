In this third section you're going to find:

1. We're using a search engine developed previously
2. We download the minisearch.py file to implement the searching functionality over the documents
2. We are using the parsed Q&A file in json format
3. We reformat the documents json file
4. Using minsearch file we need to have in mind the following:
    1. Index
        1. Ihe keyword fields are to filter the documents (knowledge base)
        2. The text fields are to find the relevant documents
    2. Fit method
        1. The fit method is prepared to receive list of dictionaries
    3. Search method
        1. boost_dict is the variable that tell our search engine the relevancy of the input variable in our documents
